  target="blank">communication medium</a> is called a pipe, it is only connected one-to-one with one pipe.
To connect multiple computers, several pipes are required. So as the number of computers increases,
we cannot continue to increase the pipe, so we use the exchanger.
Exchanger allows multiple connections with a small number of pipes

Each computer is connected to an exchange and can be connected to another counterpart by exchanging the
line between the exchanges.
The method of replacing pipes using an exchanger is called circuit switching.
In the case of circuit switching, when the line is occupied, it is no longer connected and
multiple computers cannot transmit and receive at the same time.
